            The question lies upon your mind that the way we provide application at low cost. 
            We developed using Google&apos;s <strong>Flutter</strong> Framework, which converts 
            single code into two platforms of different applications. So that we can provide both 
            Android APK and iOS App. We developed Website on Facebook&apos;s Framework{' '}
            <strong>ReactJS</strong>.
